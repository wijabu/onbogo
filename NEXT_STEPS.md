# Onbogo — Open Work & Next Steps

Tracked backlog of things we've identified but deferred. Ordered by rough priority.

---

## 1. Custom DNS name + HTTPS — DONE

Live at **https://onbogo.duckdns.org** with Let's Encrypt cert via Caddy reverse proxy.

- Static IP `34.74.221.234` reserved in GCP as `onbogo-ip`.
- A record `onbogo.duckdns.org` → static IP.
- Caddy listening on :80/:443, reverse-proxying to `localhost:8080`. Cert auto-renews every 60 days.
- Flask sees correct scheme/host via `ProxyFix` (password-reset emails correctly use `https://`).
- Gunicorn binds to `127.0.0.1:8080` only (see [onbogo.service](onbogo.service)); GCP `allow-8080` firewall rule deleted. Defense in depth: app is unreachable publicly except via Caddy.
- Session cookies hardened: `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`.

**If DuckDNS flakes:** see section 5 for Dynu backup plan.

## 2. Password reset flow — DONE

Implemented:
- `GET/POST /reset` — email input form, generates `itsdangerous` token (1-hour expiry, signed with `SECRET_KEY`), sends reset link via `notify.send_email()`. Same response whether email exists or not (prevents account enumeration).
- `GET/POST /reset/<token>` — verifies token, renders new-password form, updates password hash via `User().update_password()`, redirects to login.
- Templates: `reset_request.html`, `reset_form.html`.
- "Forgot password?" link re-enabled on login page.

**To test after deploy:** click Forgot password → enter your email → check inbox → click link → set new password → log in with new password.

**Note:** reset links will initially be `http://<vm-ip>:8080/reset/<token>` until DNS+HTTPS (item 1) is set up.

---

## 3. Login Enter-key submission

**Fixed in commit** (added `type="submit"` to login button). If pressing Enter still doesn't log in after `git pull && sudo systemctl restart onbogo`:
- Hard-refresh the browser (Cmd+Shift+R) to clear cached HTML.
- If still broken, check browser devtools Network tab — does pressing Enter fire a POST to `/login`? If yes, it's a server-side issue. If no, something is intercepting the keypress.

---

## 4. Rate limiting on /login and /reset — DONE

[flask-limiter](https://flask-limiter.readthedocs.io/) wired up with in-memory storage (fine for single-worker gunicorn):

- `POST /login` — 5 per minute per IP (brute-force protection)
- `POST /reset` — 3 per minute per IP (email-flood protection)
- `@errors.app_errorhandler(429)` flashes a friendly message and redirects back to the referring page instead of showing a raw 429.

If we ever scale to multiple gunicorn workers, swap `storage_uri` in [onbogo/extensions.py](onbogo/extensions.py) from `memory://` to `redis://` — otherwise each worker counts its own requests independently, multiplying the effective limit.

---

## 5. Backup DDNS — DONE

Dual-hostname setup live:
- **Primary:** `https://onbogo.duckdns.org`
- **Backup:** `https://onbogo.freeddns.org` (Dynu)

Both A records point at the static IP `34.74.221.234`. Caddy serves the same app on both with separate Let's Encrypt certs. If DuckDNS has another outage, users can reach the app via the Dynu hostname.

---

## 6. Other polish items (low priority)

- **Mojibake helper now shared.** `fix_encoding()` lives in [onbogo/text.py](onbogo/text.py) and is applied in both [sales.py](onbogo/sales.py) (product titles/deals) and [store.py](onbogo/store.py) (store names/addresses). If a new encoding edge case appears (e.g. CP1252 smart quotes from a different upstream source), extend the helper there — one place, two callers.
